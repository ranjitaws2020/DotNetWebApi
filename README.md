# Hello World

This is the first sample in the book. It has a `wercker.yml` file to control how Wercker builds it automatically. After every checkin, this project is built by worker and then deployed directly to Dockerhub.

You can find the docker image for this project [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/dotnetcoreservices/hello-world/tags/).
